We have a new policy regarding questions and error reports from PsN users. We ask all users to please post on the PsN-general mailing list, and not send emails to the individual developers. This practice will ensure that questions and answers become available to all who may benefit from the information, that anyone subscribing to the list is able to contribute to the discussion, and that the information is automatically archived and retrievable at a later time. Please note that the mailing list does not accept attachments, so if, for example, model code is needed to clarify a question then the code must be provided inline.
