We ask you to please post on the PsN-general mailing list, http://psn.sourceforge.net/list.php , and not send questions about PsN usage or errors to the individual developers. This practice ensures that questions and answers become available to all who may benefit from the information, that in addition to the developers anyone subscribing to the list is able to help with answers, and that the information is automatically archived and searchable at a later time. Please note that the mailing list does not accept attachments, so if, for example, model code is needed to clarify a question then the code must be provided inline.

Thank you for your understanding.
