Dear PsN users,

PsN 4.2.0 is now available for download from http://psn.sourceforge.net.

The most important changes are a complete rewrite of PsN to use the Moose object system, a new program sir for calculating uncertainty on model parameters, support for NMQual8 and a test suite for verification of PsN. 

This release also includes some very important bug fixes which in themselves are worth the effort of upgrading to 4.2.0.

Note that PsN 4.2.0 has a new minimum Perl version requirement and depends on new Perl packages. Please read the installation guide http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php before installing.

The complete list of new features and bug fixes is found on http://psn.sourceforge.net/pdfdocs/release_notes_PsN_4_2_0.txt

The PsN developers will be at PAGE to present PsN4. We look forward to seeing you there! 

Best regards,
