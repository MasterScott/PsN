Dear PsN users,

PsN 4.6.0 is now available for download from http://psn.sourceforge.net.

New features include 

* Further advancement of sir, a tool for obtaining parameter uncertainty faster than with a bootstrap and more accurately than based on the covariance step. The program runs a fully automated five-step procedure with flexible handling of assymetric parameter distributions and produces a range of diagnostic plots with detailed description of purpose and interpretation.

* simeval, a new tool for simulation-evaluation based identification of outliers.

* benchmark, a new tool for simple comparison of ofv, run times and parameter estimates across NONMEM versions and/or alternative settings of NONMEM control stream options. The program will generate and run control streams for all possible combinations of the options the user has listed.

The complete list of new features and bug fixes is found on http://psn.sourceforge.net/pdfdocs/release_notes_PsN_4_6_0.txt

Best regards,
The PsN development team
