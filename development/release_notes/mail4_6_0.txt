Dear PsN users,

PsN 4.6.0 is now available for download from http://psn.sourceforge.net.

New features include 

* Further advancement of sir, a tool for obtaining parameter uncertainty faster than with a bootstrap and more accurately than based on the covariance step. The program runs a fully automated iterative procedure and produces easy to use results, as well as diagnostic plots to support their visualization and interpretation.

* simeval, a tool for simulation-evaluation based diagnostics that aims to identify model misspecification and outliers.

* benchmark, a new tool for simple comparison of ofv, run times and parameter estimates across NONMEM versions and/or alternative settings of NONMEM control stream options. 

The complete list of new features and bug fixes is found on http://psn.sourceforge.net/pdfdocs/release_notes_PsN_4_6_0.txt

Best regards,
The PsN development team
