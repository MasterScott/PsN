************************
Installation
************************

Follow the installation instructions on
http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

************************
Documentation
************************
All documentation is found in the doc subdirectory of the PsN 
installation directory. During installation it is also possible 
to have all documentation copied to a user-specified directory.

All documentation can also be downloaded from
the PsN website http://psn.sourceforge.net/

************************
Dependencies 
************************

- It is recommended to use Xpose version 4.5.3 or later for the -cwres functionality 
  and the default execute, vpc and bootstrap R plots.

- Each userguide lists the R packages required to obtain the diagnostic R plots.
************************
Known issues 
************************

- Windows users need to be careful to choose 
  a Perl version where the extra modules needed for PsN are available. 
  For new Perl installations the PsN team recommends Strawberry Perl
  See the instructions on http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

- Installation problem on some Windows systems where 
  perl 'system' command does not work. Make sure perl module File::Copy::Recursive
  is installed *before* (re)running the installation script setup.pl

*********************************************
Changes and bug fixes from PsN 4.6.0 to n.n.n
*********************************************

   ___General___

- Bug fix: Some generated paths for the Rplots script were illegal R strings causing R to crash

   ___common_options___

- New option

   ___NONMEM output parsing___

- Bug fix: Handle error message "0ERROR IN READING FILE : FCON" in
  eigenvalue section of lst-file.
  
   ___Cluster/Grid___

- When -run_on_torque is set, PsN will now add -d <full path to NM_run subdirectory>
  to the qsub command. The qsub command will be saved to file qsubcommand in the
  NM_run subdirectory, for easier debugging.

   ___Test scripts___


   ___runrecord___

- Option -to is no longer required. The default value is the highest run number found in
  an uninterrupted sequence of files <root>1.<mod_ext>, <root>2.<mod_ext>,... etc.

New features implemented by William S. Denney of Human Predictions:
- Output to .csv using a sufficient part of RFC 4180 [https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180]
  to handle commas and quotes (optionally, not by default).
- Optionally output to .csvy files (.csv files with a YAML header; readable by the rio R
  library).  Columns can now have attributes like parameter type
  ('theta', 'omega', ...).
- Automatically detect if the output file has the extension "csv" or "csvy" and output to
  the csv/csvy format if yes and another output format has not been specifically requested.
- Automatically detect max_lvl (optionally, by default)
- Give a header column name to the child run headers to more easily distinguish them from
  empty column headers (which now should not exist) (optionally, by default).

   ___sumo___

- Bug fix: The message stating that there is no gradient information after an SAEM run was duplicated
- The checks for large relative standard errors were removed together with the options to set the limits.

   ___bootstrap___



   ___vpc/npc___


   ___frem___
-  will, if a covariate-covariate correlation is exactly 0, set intial omega estimate corresponding to 1% correlation in Model 2. Similarly in Model3, if correlation from phi-file exactly 0, or parameter-parameter covariance has to be added to create full block, then set initial estimate as 1% correlation
-  handle PRED-models without EVID/MDV column, i.e. all data records are observations.
-  handle model 2 phi file ETA all 0
-  new option -mu, i.e. use mu-modelling for added covariates. Not set by default.
-  new option -estimate_means to true. When option -estimate_means is set, only covariates which have missing observations in the frem dataset will have the mean estimated. If -no-estimate_means is set, no means will be estimated regardless of missing observations.
-  rearranged control stream changes. Now all frem code is put last in $PRED/$ERROR and no new variables are defined (this is needed for very large numbers of covariates). New option -estimate_means, default not set. If set then estimate covariate means instead of setting FIX to mean from observed data, new option -mceta, default not set. Set MCETA=N in last $ESTIMATION. New option -deriv2_nocommon_maxeta. Default 60. Set $ABBREVIATED DERIV2=NOCOMMON if number of ETAs is larger than this number.
-  put intermediate models in subdir intermediate_models instead of in m1. Handle PHI in addition to ETA in phi-file (non-classical methods), and multiple $EST (only results from last est are used).
-  set NONINFETA=1 in last estimation if it is a classical method.
-  new postprocessing script postfrem 
   ___mcmp___


   ___scm___



   ___boot_scm___


   ___ebe_npde___ 


   ___simeval___ (was ebe_npde)


   ___update_inits___

-  New options -rawres_input, -in_filter, -offset_rawres to read parameter estimates from a raw results file.

   ___parallel_retries___



   ___nca___


   ___covmat___


   ___sir___
	


   ___nmoutput2so___


   ___pvar___

- Add OFV column to results.csv
