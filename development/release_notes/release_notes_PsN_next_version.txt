*********************************************
Changes and bug fixes from PsN 4.2.0 to x.y.z
*********************************************

   ___General___

- PsN will now preserve the record order of the input model files. A new option
  -psn_record_order can be used for the legacy built in record order.

- The common option -warn_with_trace was broken and is now working again.
  It is now just a boolean option not taking any integer argument.

- New option -standardised_output to create DDMoRe standard output .xml

- Less delay (sleep) when jobs are submitted, thank you to Ruben Faelens.

- Guide common_options_defaults_version_psn.pdf has been renamed to common_options.pdf, and
  the options have been organised according to themes instead of alphabetically.
  All user guides have been revised.

- Automatic generation of R plots, see documentation in common_options.pdf

- Major rewrite of retries handling code, updated rules for selecting best retry,
  and a large number of tests for the new code. See documentation in common_options.pdf

- handle spaces in the path (enclose filepath with quotes in $DATA)

- enable option -cwres also for NM 7. 

- Complete redesign of data file handling and generation. PsN will not open the data file unless
  necessary (for bootstrapping, covariate statistics computation, ...). A large number
  of data class tests have been added to the test suite.
  Covariate statistics computation
  code for scm, boot_scm, frem and lasso have been moved to the data class.
  Data set creation for bootstrap, cdd, randtest have been moved to new data class subroutines
  and are redesigned to return file references to the created files rather than data objects. 
  Internally, PsN will use reference(s) to the data file(s) instead of passing around data objects.
  These changes affect nonpb, randtest, crossval, xv_scm, scm, bootstrap, cdd, lasso, frem 
  

- Possibility to make PsN installation portable (PsN installation directory movable).
  See documentation in psn_installation.pdf and psn_configuration.pdf

- bugfix in automatic setting of $MSFI when option -maxevals or -handle_crashes is set. Make sure existing 
  $MSFI and possible options are not overwritten if $MSFI already exists in model file. 

- Possible to set -directory=path/to/folder where path/to does not yest exist. Before you could 
  only specify a path with several levels in -dir if all but the last directory already existed. 

- Expanded test suite

- support para mode for NMQual, see NMQual section in psn_configuration.pdf.

- bugfix broken option -mirror_plots

- PsN can call the converter toolbox to automatically convert a PharmML-format model
  to nmtran format, if converter_path in psn.conf is set to the converter classpath and java is installed.

- rewrite of -stop_motion functionality

- centralisation of round,ceil and other basic math functions to separate module with new tests.

- Removed all usage of Perl's looks_like_number since it behaves differently on windows and unix. 
  Replaced with PsN's own math::usable_number which uses regexp to see if string interpretation 
  is a number.

- resume functionality internally in modelfit. If model->is_run read existing lst-file, do not run. Run
  models that are not run, create raw_results. Currently accessible only from bootstrap

- removed attribute rerun

- removed option -prepend_model_to_lst

- New runrecord annotation handling

- change how data class computes median: first compute median for individual and then over individuals

- Nicer formatting for -verbose output

- Allow empty lines (,,,,,,,,,,) in -rawres_input files.

   ___Cluster/grid interaction___

- bugfix for run_on_slurm: Request specific format of jobID when using squeue to find finished jobs,
  so that jobID cannot be truncated.

- bugfix in printing slurm sbatch command to file for easier debugging.
   ___NONMEM interaction___

- bugfix handle multiple $SIZES records

- FIXED and FIXE are allowed as synonyms to FIX in $OMEGA and $SIGMA

- bugfix: handle comma-separated sets of parentheses in $THETA, for example $THETA (1 FIX), (2 FIX) 

- bugfix: support (init,options) and (options,init) form of $OMEGA/$SIGMA in addition 
  to form with space instead of comma. Bugfix in parsing of (low init high) with spaces 
  instead of comma in $THETA. Bugfix pattern matching when searching for CORRELATION, CHOLESKY 
  etc in $SIGMA, match parts of string instead of just whole string. Added tests

- bug fix parsing output from run when NONMEM crashes during covariance step

- bug fix parsing of eigenvalues in NM7.3 lst-file when ext-file is missing

- bug fix handle value +Infinity and similar in NM7 output files .ext cov coi cor phi 

- changed default of -check_nmtran to off.

- if option -check_nmtran is set and model contains verbatim code, then PsN will try to detect 
  undefined variables in abbreviated code by creating a dummy model without the verbatim code and 
  running nmtran on the dummy. If nmtran gives error "UNDEFINED VARIABLE" then PsN will parse nmtran 
  output for the variable name and print a warning telling the user to double check that the variable 
  is defined. If the variable is defined in verbatim code then the warning will be printed even 
  if all is well, but this information is included in the warning. 

- parsing of NONMEM output: STANDARD/CORRELATION form estimates and se:s of OMEGA and SIGMA are 
  now parsed from lst or ext file.
  Note: PsN still does not support STANDARD/CORRELATION form when updating a model with final estimates
  from a previous run (update_inits, vpc, frem, ...). 

- bug fix in output parsing. If multiple $EST and a est-step that is not the last had text in 
  lst saying "PROGRAM TERMINATED BY OBJ" then PsN would consider the whole run failed, even 
  though a later est-step was successful. 

- Rewritten code for reading cov, cor and coi matrices from NONMEM. Rewritten filtering for
  removing rows and columns for parameters that are not estimated (FIXED or SAME).
  Now PsN will parse cov, cor, coi independently instead of requiring that all are found
  in order to parse any.

- Rewrite of code for parsing shrinkage and etabar.

- Bugfix parsing of lst-files for NM 6.1.

- If PsN detects an NMtran error as the cause of a missing lst-file, then add the 
  contents of FMSG (the nmtran error message file) to the message that PsN prints to screen 
  saying that there was an nmtran error. 

- Improved handling of NMTRAN error messages and license error messages that appear in the lst-file. 
  Store those pre-run messages in parsing_error_message that can be displayed by e.g. sumo

   ___sumo___

- sumo now prints delta-ofv if the "Based on:" annotation is present in model
- bugfix running sumo on file without extension .res or .lst would cause a crash
- output use labels instead of generic coordinates, skip parameter that are fixed or same
- print shrinkage from NMoutput, print number of individuals and observation records 

   ___vpc/npc___

- vpc binning can now take multiple arrays for -bin_array or -auto_bin to use for different strata
- When F_FLAG=0 PsN will now also allow ICALL == 4 witout complaining.
- new option -irep to vpc and npc. An alternative way of marking beginning of new simulation sample
  in -sim_table. This makes it easier to use R-processed data as input, since the NONMEM-type
  header is not needed at the beginning of each new sample. 
- vpc/npc can be run without an input model when option -sim_table and -orig_table are used.
- vpc/npc will set NOAPPEND in $TABLE, and instead add items DV, PRED, WRES and/or RES explicitly if needed.
- vpc: Added prediction intervals 25% and 75% to -fine_pi, now -fine_pi gives 
  intervals 0,10,20,25,30,40,50,60,70,75,80,90 and 95% 
- the vpc_results file will include a column with median idv value for each bin.
- bugfix: if lloq and/or uloq is used, only display mean and delta-mean for real values if 0 real 
  observations were below lloq or above uloq. 
- bugfix: handle global paths to input files on windows (sim_table, orig_table, sim_model)
- bugfix: binning when bin_by_count=0 and either no_of_bins or single_bin_size without overlap,
  could sometimes get observation(s) with single highest idv in stratum excluded from 
  last bin because of numerical error.

   ___scm___

- scm now checks that all covariates in the code section are listed as test_relations
  and gives an error otherwise.

- input check that W is defined in model when using option time_varying

- When scm runs a dummy model to filter the data set on IGNORE/ACCEPT before
  computing statistics for covariates, any DROP/SKIP in $INPUT will be kept.
  The first undropped column will be copied to the dropped positions
  in $TABLE of the filter model, so that the filtered data set still has
  the same number of columns and the same $INPUT record with its DROPs/SKIPs
  can be used for the scm models.

- Removed broken scm config file option -base_criteria_values.

- new command-line option -base_ofv to replace -base_criteria_values.

- updated and corrected warnings related to time-varying covariates 

   ___boot_scm___

- Removed broken option -base_criteria_values.

- updated and corrected warnings related to time-varying covariates 

- bugfix make sure base model is run for each bootstrap data set 
   ___sse___

-  sse will accept missing data files for alternative models. This is ok since data will be replaced with 
   simulated data anyway. 

-  sse will accept running with -samples=1

   ___bootstrap___

-  bootstrap can now be automatically resumed also when -clean=3 in original run. Set -directory to existing 
   directory of interrupted run, then samples that were finished will be read into memory directly and only samples 
   that were not finished will be run with NONMEM.

-  New option -no-run_base_model. By default bootstrap will run the base model if lst-file is not available, but 
   if -no-run_base_model is set then the base model will not be run even if lst-file is missing. If no output 
   from the base model is available, the bootstrap will still continue and produce results, although there will 
   be no parameter of ofv for the base model in the raw_results file.

-  New option -no-update_inits. By default the bootstrap models will get the final estimates of the base model 
   as initial estimates, provided that base model lst-file is available. If option -no-update_inits is set, 
   the bootstrap models will get the same initial estimates as the base model, even if final estimates are 
   available from the lst-file.

-  New option -summarize: recompute bootstrap_results.csv based on existing raw_results. 

-  new command-line option copy_data

-  Added error message for bootstrap stratify_on When there are more columns in $INPUT than in the 
   data file and the stratify_on is set to a column with higher number than the number of columns 
   in the data file the resulting error message is to hard to understand. Added a separate error 
   message for this situation.
   ___update_inits___
	 
- New guide update_inits_userguide.pdf
- update is now an alias for update_inits on all platforms.
  update is versioned like all other scripts.
  For example: update-4.3.0 will be equivalent to update_inits-4.3.0
- model files with mulitple $PROB are now supported.
- $MSFI filename of second and later $PROB will be updated
- new options -update_fix, -fix_thetas, -unfix_thetas
- removed option -diagonal_dominance. New option -ensure_posdef with same intent (ensure that
  OMEGA and SIGMA blocks are positive definite) but better algorithm.
- Modified procedure for automatic renumbering, see details in userguide.
- support any extension (.ctl, .mod, .txt) of control stream.

   ___randtest___
	 
- two new options: 1) -update_inits with default true: update initial estimates before estimating 
  with randomized data 2) -full_model_inits with default false, i.e. use final estimates from full 
  model estimation on input data rather than base model estimates from input data as initial 
  estimates for randomized data estimation.

- When a base model is given and retries functionality is turned on (-retries >0, -tweak_inits is on),
  initiate a retry when the ofv of a sample is worse than the ofv of the base model, i.e. local minimum.

- a new csv-format output file with actual delta-ofv at different p-values, and actual p-values for 
  theoretical dofv:s from chisquare distribution. 
	 
- new command-line option copy_data
   ___execute___
	 
- Automatically unset display_iterations if -silent is set

- removed options -summarize and fake functionality. 	 

- New option -reduced_model_ofv. Initiate a retry unless ofv is at least as good as this value.
  Option -retries must be set > 0 for it to have effect. See details in execute userguide.

- timestamp option for directory name

- option -model_dir_name will skip model extension, and there will be no dot between 
  dir and the number. For example run2.mod will give rundir name run2.dir1. 

   ___parallel_retries___
	 
- New option -timestamp for directory name

- option -model_dir_name will skip model extension, and there will be no dot between dir 
  and the number. For example run2.mod will give rundir name run2.dir1. 

- parallel_retries will behave more like execute, i.e. the best try
  will be selected and the output files of this try will be copied
  to the directory of the input model.

- new userguide

   ___sir___
	 
- New option -covmat_input	 	 
- New option -rawres_input
- More input checks
- Modified algorithm, see user guide.
- New output file with NONMEM-like format empirical covariance matrix
- new command-line option copy_data
   ___covmat___
	 
- New script, compute variance-covariance matrix based on -rawres_input

   ___precond___
	 
- New tool, preconditioning of model

   ___pvar___

- Added default plot
- pvar will also run base model from scm, pvar can handle scm results after clean<=2.
- Updated pvar_results.csv to include model name.

   ___frem___

- It will be checked that SIGMA and OMEGA blocks are postive definite, 
  using Cholesky decomposition. If non-positive definite the diagonal will
  be inflated slightly until positive definite

   ___llp___

- input check that omega or sigma selected is not part of a BLOCK, which of course cannot be individually FIXED.
- Updated documentation on omega and sigma input.
- bugfix handling of numerical issues in search for new parameter value guess 

   ___nmoutput2so___

- new script

   ___pind___

- bugfix handle setting of -clean=3
