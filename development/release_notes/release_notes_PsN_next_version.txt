************************
Installation
************************

Follow the installation instructions on
http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

************************
Documentation
************************
All documentation is found in the doc subdirectory of the PsN 
installation directory. During installation it is also possible 
to have all documentation copied to a user-specified directory.

All documentation can also be downloaded from
the PsN website http://psn.sourceforge.net/

************************
Dependencies 
************************

- It is recommended to use Xpose version 4.5.3 for the -cwres functionality 
  and the default execute, vpc and bootstrap R plots.

************************
Known issues 
************************

- Windows users need to be careful to choose 
  a Perl version where the extra modules needed for PsN are available. See the 
  instructions on http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

- Installation problem on some Windows systems where 
  perl 'system' command does not work. Make sure perl module File::Copy::Recursive
  is installed *before* (re)running the installation script setup.pl

*********************************************
Changes and bug fixes from PsN 4.4.8 to n.n.n
*********************************************

   ___General___

- New option -zip to automatically zip and remove the m1 folder.
  PsN can also seamlessly handle zipped m1 folders for subsequent runs using the same run directory.
- New option -citations to print a list of references for each tool in BibTeX format.
- The option -degree used for tweak_inits can now take degrees greater than 1.
- Faster -help, -h, -version and some option error checking.
- Bug fix: Detection of non-unique parameter labels when reading a raw results file.
- Bug fix: Reading of NONMEM lst-file when there were no unfixed parameters in the model,
  or when $MSFI was used, i.e. no $THETA/$OMEGA/$SIGMA in the model file.
- Inside NM_run subdirectories, the selected (re)try files will be moved,
  instead of copied, to psn.mod, psn.lst etc. This is to save disk I/O.
  This means that the numbered (re)try files for the selected run will
  not be left in NM_run.
- Skip parsing of phi-files for a regular modelfit run. 
- Refactored parsing of ext-files.
- If a NONMEM run is killed by a system, for example due to a job time limit, the file OUTPUT
  with iteration results will not be appended to the lst-file by the nmfe script. If PsN
  option -handle_crashes or -handle_msfo is set, PsN will parse OUTPUT if the lst-file appears
  to not have had OUTPUT appended, and initiate a crash restart if it appears to be useful.
- All scripts can print help texts without having nm_version properly defined in psn.conf
- Bug fix: torque job submission regexp only take job ID number part of qsub response, not whole string
- Bug fix: Clean up in all code to get rid of Perl warnings about uninitialized variables.

   ___lasso___

- Refactoring, new unit tests.
- Bug fix: Centering of categorical covariates and covariates with piece-wise 
  linear relations in final model.
- More documentation.
- New options -adaptive, -adjusted, -al_coefficients, -log_scale, -normalize, -run_final_model
- Removed option -lst_file (check)

   ___sumo___


   ___bootstrap___

- Updated rplots template.
- Bug fix: Summary calculations in bootstrap_results.csv were wrong if original model was filtered
  out as a result of any of the -skip options.
- Bug fix: Summary calculations in bootstrap_results.csv were missing if original model was not
  estimated or had no .lst-file when using option -no-run_base_model
- Bug fix: Summary calculations for standard errors were wrong if only a subset of non-skipped
  samples had successful covariance steps.
- Bug fix: If option -dofv is used then set delta-ofv undefined instead of equal to evaluation ofv
  if original sample had undefined ofv.
- Bug fix: More robust search for ID in IGNORE statements to warn about renumbering of individuals
  during bootstrapping of data sets.
- Bug fix: Filter out crashed runs (ofv and estimates NA) when doing summary calculations when
  those runs have not already been filtered out by any -skip option.
- Bug fix: On 32bit windows udistr(0.5), which should be 0, is wrong. Set special case for udistr(0.5).

   ___vpc/npc___

- Option -sim_table may now be either a single file name or a comma-separated list
  of file names.

   ___frem___

- Complete rewrite of program.

- New tests


   ___scm___

- More robust filtering on IGNORE/ACCEPT

- Bug fix computation of covariate theta bounds for linear and hockey-stick
  parameterization when median of covariate is negative.

- Redesign of covariate code generation and computation of covariate theta
  bounds and initial values, new tests.

   ___boot_scm___

- More robust filtering on IGNORE/ACCEPT

- Bug fix: Use common options, e.g. -nm_version, that are set on command-line.

- Bug fix: If valid states not set in scm config file then use default set of valid states.

   ___simeval___ (was ebe_npde)

- Renamed from ebe_npde to simeval
- Separate decorrelation of iiv etas, ans iov etas per occasion
- New output files
- New rplots template 
- New option -n_simulation_models, allowing more than one sample per NONMEM control stream
- Computation of npde for IWRES and CWRES.
- vpc plots of DV vs PRED and CWRES vs idv (TIME).

   ___update_inits___

- The option -degree can now take degrees greater than 1.
- New functionality for automatic Cholesky reparameterization of OMEGA and SIGMA, and inverse or reparameterization,
  with and without bounded thetas.
- Not required to have model or lst-file to read parameter values from, can update other model properties anyway
- Do not update based_on tag if output and input models are the same
- New option -silent, to suppress all log messages.

   ___execute___
	 

   ___sir___
	
- New options -auto_rawres,-boxcox
- Recentering, stats for local minima
- more output
- Algorithm changes, boxcox is new
- Resume/Restart functionality
- Automatic rplots with diagnostic graphs
- Defaults for -samples and -resamples

   ___precond___

- New option -copy_data. Used in the same way as for execute 
- Cleanup of error messages and information about unidentifiability

   ___runrecord___


   ___benchmark___

- A new tool for systematic comparisons of ofv, parameter estimates and
  run times across different combinations of NONMEM record settings,
  THETA initial estimates and NONMEM/compiler versions. See details
  in benchmark_userguide.pdf.

   ___psn___

- The option -nm_versions now also print the path to the psn.conf that was used,
  and, if defined in psn.conf, a description of each NM version.

   ___nmoutput2so___

- Bug fix: misspelling of Parameter in SE and RSE table
- Bug fix: Don't create covariance_step_warnings and covariance_step_successful warnings if $COV not specified
- Bug fix: Don't give message minimization_successful after simulation
- Add Bootstrap/PrecisionEstimates. Currently with one single alpha.
- Add bootstrap parameters not on var/cov scale. Also add a warning listing these parameters.
- Add description to TimeStamp explaining that unit is hours.
- Add more PsN result files to RawResults. Also set specific oids for easier retrieval

   ___crossval___

- The crossval script now prints version_and_option_info.txt to the run directory.

___se_of_eta___

- Program is removed, because the program output is given by NONMEM in phi-file.
