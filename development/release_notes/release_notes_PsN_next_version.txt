************************
Installation
************************

Follow the installation instructions on
http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

************************
Documentation
************************
All documentation is found in the doc subdirectory of the PsN 
installation directory. During installation it is also possible 
to have all documentation copied to a user-specified directory.

All documentation can also be downloaded from
the PsN website http://psn.sourceforge.net/

************************
Dependencies 
************************

- It is recommended to use Xpose version 4.5.3 for the -cwres functionality 
  and the default execute, vpc and bootstrap R plots.

************************
Known issues 
************************

- Windows users need to be careful to choose 
  a Perl version where the extra modules needed for PsN are available. See the 
  instructions on http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

- Installation problem on some Windows systems where 
  perl 'system' command does not work. Make sure perl module File::Copy::Recursive
  is installed *before* (re)running the installation script setup.pl

*********************************************
Changes and bug fixes from PsN 4.4.8 to n.n.n
*********************************************

   ___General___

- The option -degree used for tweak_inits can now take degrees greater than 1.
- Faster -help, -h, -version and some option error checking.
- Bug fix: Detection of non-unique parameter labels when reading a raw results file.
- Bug fix: Reading of NONMEM lst-file when there were no unfixed parameters in the model,
  or when $MSFI was used, i.e. no $THETA/$OMEGA/$SIGMA in the model file.

   ___lasso___

- Refactoring, new unit tests.
- Bug fix: Centering of categorical covariates and covariates with piece-wise 
  linear relations in final model.
- More documentation.
- New options -adaptive, -adjusted, -al_coefficients, -log_scale, -normalize, -run_final_model
- Removed option -lst_file (check)

   ___sumo___



   ___vpc/npc___

- Bug fix: 


   ___frem___

- Complete rewrite of program.

- New tests


   ___scm___

- More robust filtering on IGNORE/ACCEPT

   ___boot_scm___

- More robust filtering on IGNORE/ACCEPT

   ___simeval___ (was ebe_npde)

- Renamed from ebe_npde to simeval

- Separate decorrelation of iiv etas, ans iov etas per occasion

- New output files

- New rplots template 

- New option -n_simulation_models, allowing more than one sample per NONMEM control stream

   ___update_inits___

- The option -degree can now take degrees greater than 1.
- New functionality for automatic Cholesky reparameterization of OMEGA and SIGMA, and inverse
- Not required to have model or lst-file to read parameter values from, can update other model properties anyway

   ___execute___
	 

   ___sir___
	
- New options -auto_rawres,-boxcox
- Recentering, stats for local minima
- more output
- Algorithm changes, boxcox is new
- Resume/Restart functionality
- Automatic rplots with diagnostic graphs
- Defaults for -samples and -resamples

   ___precond___

- New option -copy_data. Used in the same way as for execute 


   ___runrecord___


   ___benchmark___

- New tool

   ___psn___

- The option -nm_versions now also print the path to the psn.conf that was used.

   ___nmoutput2so___

- Bug fix: misspelling of Parameter in SE and RSE table
- Bug fix: Don't create covariance_step_warnings and covariance_step_successful warnings if $COV not specified
- Bug fix: Don't give message minimization_successful after simulation
- Add Bootstrap/PrecisionEstimates. Currently with one single alpha.
- Add bootstrap parameters not on var/cov scale. Also add a warning listing these parameters.
- Add description to TimeStamp explaining that unit is hours.
- Add more PsN result files to RawResults. Also set specific oids for easier retrieval

   ___so_tool___

- New tool with the purpose of collecting small standardised output utilities
- New function 'merge' that can merge multiple so-files with multiple SOBlocks into one file
- New function 'pretty' that makes an so human readable (for example so:s created with nmoutput2so without -pretty) 

   ___se_of_eta___

- Program is removed, because the program output is given by NONMEM in phi-file.
