************************
Installation
************************

Follow the installation instructions on
http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

************************
Documentation
************************
All documentation is found in the doc subdirectory of the PsN 
installation directory. During installation it is also possible 
to have all documentation copied to a user-specified directory.

All documentation can also be downloaded from
the PsN website http://psn.sourceforge.net/

************************
Dependencies 
************************

- Xpose must, if used, be version 4.2.1 or later to handle PsN-3.5.3 or later 
  output format. It is recommended to use the latest Xpose release
  from http://xpose.sf.net

************************
Known issues 
************************

- Windows users need to be careful to choose 
  a Perl version where the extra modules needed for PsN are available. See the 
  instructions on http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

- Installation problem on some Windows systems where 
  perl 'system' command does not work. Make sure perl module File::Copy::Recursive
  is installed *before* (re)running the installation script setup.pl

*********************************************
Changes and bug fixes from PsN 4.2.0 to x.y.z
*********************************************

   ___General___

- PsN will now preserve the record order of the input model files. A new option
  -psn_record_order can be used for the legacy built in record order.

- The common option -warn_with_trace was broken and is now working again.
  It is now just a boolean option not taking any integer argument.

- New option -standardised_output to create DDMoRe standard output .xml

- Less delay (sleep) when jobs are submitted.

- rplots option

- Updated rules for selecting best retry

- handle spaces in the path (enclose filepath with quotes in $DATA)

- enable option -cwres also for NM 7. 

- major redesign of data file handling. PsN will now not parse or reformat the data file unless
  necessary (bootstrapping, coviarate statistics computation, ...)

   ___Cluster/grid interaction___

   ___NONMEM interaction___

- FIXED and FIXE are allowed as synonyms to FIX in $OMEGA and $SIGMA

   ___sumo___

- sumo now prints delta-ofv if the "Based on:" annotation is present in model
- running sumo on file without extension .res or .lst would cause a crash

   ___vpc/npc___

- vpc binning can now take multiple arrays for -bin_array or -auto_bin to use for different strata
- When F_FLAG=0 PsN now also allow ICALL == 4
- new option -irep to vpc and npc. An alternative way of marking beginning of new simulation sample
  in -sim_table. This makes it easier to use R-processed data as input, since the NONMEM-type
  header is not needed at the beginning of each new sample. 
- vpc/npc can be run without an input model when option -sim_table and -orig_table are used.
- vpc/npc will set NOAPPEND in $TABLE, and instead add items DV, PRED, WRES and/or RES explicitly if needed.
- vpc: Added prediction intervals 25% and 75% to -fine_pi, now -fine_pi gives 
  intervals 0,10,20,25,30,40,50,60,70,75,80,90 and 95% 

   ___scm___

- scm now checks that all covariates in the code section are listed as test_relations
  and gives an error otherwise.

- When scm runs a dummy model to filter the data set on IGNORE/ACCEPT before
  computing statistics for covariates, any DROP/SKIP in $INPUT will be kept.
  The first undropped column will be copied to the dropped positions
  in $TABLE of the filter model, so that the filtered data set still has
  the same number of columns and the same $INPUT record with its DROPs/SKIPs
  can be used for the scm models.

   ___sse___

-  sse will accept missing data files for alternative models. This is ok since data will be replaced with 
   simulated data anyway. 

-  sse will accept running with -samples=1

   ___bootstrap___

-  bootstrap can now be automatically resumed also when -clean=3 in original run. Just set -directory to existing 
   directory of interrupted run, then samples that were finished will be read into memory directly and only samples 
   that were not finished will be run with NONMEM.

-  New option -no-run_base_model. By default bootstrap will run the base model if lst-file is not available, but 
   if -no-run_base_model is set then the base model will not be run even if lst-file is missing. If no output 
   from the base model is available, the bootstrap will still continue and produce results, although there will 
   be no parameter of ofv for the base model in the raw_results file.

-  New option -no-update_inits. By default the bootstrap models will get the final estimates of the base model 
   as initial estimates, provided that base model lst-file is available. If option -no-update_inits is set, 
   the bootstrap models will get the same initial estimates as the base model, even if final estimates are 
   available from the lst-file.

-  New option -summarize: recompute bootstrap_results.csv based on existing raw_results. 

   ___update_inits___
	 
- update is now always an alias for update_inits on all platforms.
  update is versioned like all other scripts.
  For example: update-4.3.0 will be equivalent to update_inits-4.3.0
- model files with mulitple $PROB are now supported.
- $MSFI filename of second and later $PROB will be updated
   ___randtest___
	 
- two new options: 1) -update_inits with default true: update initial estimates before estimating 
  with randomized data 2) -full_model_inits with default false, i.e. use final estimates from full 
  model estimation on input data rather than base model estimates from input data as initial 
  estimates for randomized data estimation.
- a new csv-format output file with actual delta-ofv at different p-values, and actual p-values for 
  theoretical dofv:s from chisquare distribution. 
	 
   ___execute___
	 
- New option -reduced_model_ofv. Initiate a retry unless ofv is at least as good as this value.
  Option -retries must be set > 0 for it to have effect.

- timestamp option for directory name

   ___parallel_retries___
	 
- New option -timestamp for directory name

- parallel_retries will behave more like execute, i.e. the best try
  will be selected and the output files of this try will be copied
  to the directory of the input model.

- new userguide

   ___sir___
	 
- Option -covmat_input	 	 

   ___covmat___
	 
- New script, compute variance-covariance matrix based on -rawres_input

   ___precond___
	 
- New tool, preconditioning of model
