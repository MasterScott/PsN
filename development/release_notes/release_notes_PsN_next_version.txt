************************
Installation
************************

Follow the installation instructions on
https://uupharmacometrics.github.io/PsN/install.html

************************
Documentation
************************
All documentation is found in the doc subdirectory of the PsN 
installation directory. During installation it is also possible 
to have all documentation copied to a user-specified directory.

All documentation can also be downloaded from
the PsN website https://uupharmacometrics.github.io/PsN/docs.html

************************
Dependencies 
************************

- It is recommended to use Xpose version 4.5.3 or later for the -cwres functionality 
  and the default execute, vpc and bootstrap R plots.

- Each userguide lists the R packages required to obtain the diagnostic R plots.

************************
Known issues 
************************

- Windows users need to be careful to choose 
  a Perl version where the extra modules needed for PsN are available. 
  For new Perl installations the PsN team recommends Strawberry Perl
  See the instructions on https://uupharmacometrics.github.io/PsN/install.html

- Installation problem on some Windows systems where 
  perl 'system' command does not work. Make sure perl module File::Copy::Recursive
  is installed *before* (re)running the installation script setup.pl

*********************************************
Changes and bug fixes from PsN 4.8.0 to x.x.x
*********************************************




   ___General___

- Dots in datasets will always be seen by PsN as zero, which is the same way NM-TRAN handles dots. This will
  change the behaviour of transitions in randtest.
- Empty items between commas in data set will be interpreted as zero (this is default NM-TRAN interpretation)


   ___common_options___

- New clean level 5 to remove entire rundirectory
- New option -debug_rmd to retain the tex file after rendering rmarkdown with -rplots


   ___NONMEM output parsing___



   ___Cluster/Grid___



   ___Test scripts___



   ___crossval___

- Add -stratify_on option



   ___runrecord___


   ___sumo___

- New option -parameters to only show parameter estimates

   ___mcmp___

- Fix bug causing columns with names ending with DATE to become removed


   ___bootstrap___

- Phi files from $ETAS will be used for dOFV calculation runs


   ___vpc/npc___

- Fix bug causing simulation tables after a tte run being copied to the wrong directory when using the -model_subdir option

   ___frem___

- Give useful error message if a covariate has zero variance at baseline.
- Add OFV for M1-M4 in frem_results

 
   ___proseval___



   ___scm___

- linearized scm will now initialize etas with phi file of base model for each iteration.


   ___linearize___


   ___nca___


   ___xv_scm___



   ___sse___ 

- New option -special_table to let the user handle the table generation in the simulation model


   ___simeval___

   ___update_inits___


   ___parallel_retries___


   ___sir___
	
- Force input cov matrix to be positive definite after giving a warning.
- Force matrix used for sampling to be positive definite.
- Phi files from $ETAS will be used for dOFV calculation runs

   ___precond___


   ___cdd___

- New option 'ignore' that would let cdd use IGNORE statements instead of generating new datasets. This will save alot of disk space.
