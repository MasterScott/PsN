Dear PsN users,

PsN 4.4.0 is now available for download from http://psn.sourceforge.net.

New features include 

* precond, a new tool for automatic preconditioning of a NONMEM model to improve its numerical properties. The preconditioning method, which has been developed by Yasunori Aoki, will be presented during the Stuart Beal Methodology Session at PAGE 2015.

* major additions to sir, a tool for obtaining parameter uncertainty faster than with a bootstrap and more accurately than based on the covariance step.

* the -rplots option, a simple yet powerful feature for generating default or custom R plots for visualizing PsN output. For example, the PsN nca program can, using this new feature and Chayan Acharya's ncappc R package for non-compartmental analysis, create a basic R script that can easily be extended for custom nca analysis for a specific project. The ncappc package is available from CRAN.

The complete list of new features and bug fixes is found on http://psn.sourceforge.net/pdfdocs/release_notes_PsN_4_4_0.txt

Best regards,
The PsN development team
