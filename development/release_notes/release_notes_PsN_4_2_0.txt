  output format. It is recommended to use the latest Xpose release
  from http://xpose.sf.net

************************
Known issues 
************************

- Windows users need to be careful to choose 
  a Perl version where the extra modules needed for PsN are available. See the 
  instructions on http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

- Installation problem on some Windows systems where 
  perl 'system' command does not work. Make sure perl module File::Copy::Recursive
  is installed *before* (re)running the installation script setup.pl

*********************************************
Changes and bug fixes from PsN 3.7.6 to 4.2.0
*********************************************

   ___General___

- All modules have been converted from the old dia class system to Moose. All _subs.pm files
  have been converted into .pm files that can be used directly by Perl without the need for
	dia2code or fill_diacode.pl

- All internal parameter checking is now done with MooseX::Params::Validate

- PsN now comes bundled with a test suite used for verification

- PsN now supports Strawberry perl on Windows and ActivePerl on Mac

- New common option -degree to all scripts, coupled to tweak_inits. Before, degree was hard-coded
  to 0.1, i.e. a perturbation of 10%, but now the user can choose the perturbation.
	Must be a number between 0 and 1. 

- tweak_inits will now perturb initial estimates by 'degree' relative to the original initial estimates,
  regardless of how many retries have been done. Before the perturbation would be larger and larger
	for every retry. 

- For runs with clean=0 a file called 'modelfile' is created in all NM_run directories. This
  files contains the original name of the modelfile and can e.g. be used to set job name in
	wrapper scripts.

- NMQual8 support. Complete redesign, removed nmqual_xml option, handle .log.xml as standard
  output file from NONMEM that can be requested with -nm_output option. 
 
- PsN.pm is now treated as any PsN module and resides in the lib directory after installation

- Redesign of tbs. New options -tbs_lambda, -tbs_delta -tbs_zeta and -dtbs

- Bugfix: divide by zero in ccontra file for -tbs option

- Versioned executables (for example "execute-4.2.0") now works in Windows

- Handle Windows line breaks in model files and rawres_input files even if running on linux

- Changed format of nnn_results.csv, e.g. sse_results.csv, to use 7 significant digits and either
  scientific or decimal notation. Before it was always 5 decimals in decimal notation.

- Bugfix in reading of matrices (covariance matrix, inv cov matrix) from lst-file, make sure matrices are
  stored even if files .cov and .coi are missing.

- Bugfix in reading matrices from lst-file, remove NM7-tag before converting to MatrixReal

- Options -drop_dropped, -unwrap_table_files, -extra_data_files, -nmqual_xml, -run_on_sge_nmfe
  -run_on_lsf_nmfe and -wrap_data have been removed

- Bugfix data renumber_ascending and resamle, turn off redundant writes to data file.

- Cleaning in tool.pm, remove unused ForkManager

- Make modelfit->run create all NM_run subdirectories before copying any input or starting any runs.
  All NM_run subdirectories will be created simultaneously before any nonmem run is started.

- More careful pre_compile_cleanup, leave cleaning of psn.lst and OUTPUT to nmfe.

- Bufix in handling of labels, sometimes PsN would crash because labels in model were not unique during
  updating of initial estimates. Now PsN will append a _ (underscore) to the label if necessary to make
	it unique.

- Bugfix: Solved data bug where lines that did not start with a digit or a dot would be filtered out
  before bootstrapping/case deletion/statistics computations. Make sure data class uses NONMEM's IGNORE
	sign, if set, make sure ID column number, if known, sent to data->new, more careful parsing of data set lines

- Bugfix: do not read final estimates from .ext if lst-file shows that NONMEM aborted the run

- Give a warning if old Mac text file (with only 0x0D as newline) format is used.

- Bugfix in modelfit in verbose after cleaning > 2

- Bugfix in seed reset in modelfit based on NM_run number, could handle very large numbers

- Corrected logic and run number dependence in delay code to avoid new process overload, max_fork_delay section
 
- New document developers_guide.pdf with information for developers and testers

- Bugfix: Fix regular expression in TBLN tag search to pick up a number and nothing else
 
- Bugfix: Sometimes PsN runs on Windows got stuck in an infinite loop

- Bugfix: Some Linux distributions (e.g. Fedora) needed the Digest::MD5 module for PsN to run.

- Bugfix: some specific data sets (e.g. starting with a minus sign) could not be handled properly resulting in
  loss of data.


   ___Cluster/grid interaction___

- All job submission code has been rewritten. No perl process will be submitted to any cluster.
  Only nmfe or nmqual executions will be submitted. Code for each cluster/grid type is in its own class.

- Option -slurm_project is renamed to -slurm_account (maps to sbatch option -A).

- New option -slurm_partition which maps to sbatch -p

- More robust slurm squeue commands to handle squeue error messages (e.g. Socket timed out)
  PsN will ask for completed, cancelled etc jobs using squeue options instead of checking for
	running jobs. This requires that the slurm option MinJobAge is not too small.

- changes in slurm submit, submit entire bash script that first loops until psn.lst not visible, psn.mod
  is visible, and only then submit nmfe call. If invalid user id then try again a few times.

- All output redirections will now be to nmfe_output.txt

- Version of used nmfe script is written to version_and_option_info.txt


   ___NONMEM interaction___

- Support for new NONMEM 7.3 records $THETAI, $THETAR, $THETAP, $THETAPV, $OMEGAP, $OMEGAPD, $SIGMAP,
  $SIGMAPD

- Order in which PsN prints records changed. $ABBREIVATED now comes after $DATA

- Handle **** instead of subproblem number 10000 etc in lst-file when $SIM NSUBS>9999 in NONMEM 7.3

- Different default values for different NONMEM versions can be set in configuration file psn.conf.

- PsN will look for nonmem_mpi.exe and similar when checking compiler success when diagnosing missing lst-file

- Changed common option nmfe_options to verbatim string instead of comma separated list


   ___sse___

- New feature random_estimation_inits 

- New option -keep_tables, default is to remove tables.

- NSUBS from pre-existing $SIMULATION will be deleted.

- More robust to transient job errors in file sync etc. If individual simulations or estimations have problems
  that run will be marked as failed, but sse will continue.

- Changed definition of skewness and kurtosis to standard definitions, see updated userguide

- Turn off redundant write to original data file copy in m1

- Bugfix: make sure common model_options are propagated to models when restarting an sse

- Bugfix: in rawres input: allow third column to be model to handle new headers in sse.

- Bugfix: in sse when simulating with prior, setting inits output file in control streams.


   ___scm___

- scm config file is copied to scm run directory (also for boot_scm and xv_scm)

- Bugfix: handling more than 50 input cols in filter_data.mod, set SIZES PD

- boot_scm will only use $INPUT for stratify_on, will ignore headers in datafile


   ___npc/vpc___

- Default name of rundirectory is now vpc_dir

- Around 40% faster autobinning

- Parameters for binning algorithm are now easily changeable from within the code

- Bugfix: Relax parameter checking when using bin_array on values for vpc

- Bugfix: Make sure new model objects (e.g. after flip_comments) get copy of common_options::model_options

- Bugfix: npc printing name of sim model in output


   ___bootstrap___

- New option -keep_tables, default is to remove tables. 


   ___mcmp___

- More clear error message when NM7.3 bug TABLE FIRSTONLY occurs


   ___cdd___

- Bugfix: redundant data writes have been turned off


   ___parallel_retries___

- New options -rawres_input, -offset_rawres, -in_filter and -samples to be used as alternatives to -min_retries.
  Function of options as in sse, except that inits are for estimation instead.


   ___ebe_npde___

- Script rewritten. Now iofv data from phi will be processed and npde:s computed


   ___frem___

- Changes to handle start_eta option


   ___pvar___

- First release of new tool "parametric variability"


   ___linearize___

- Default name of rundirectory is now linearize_dir

- Name of logfile changed to linlog.txt

- Comment SCM-LINEARIZE-CONSTANTS have been removed from base model in linearize program


   ___nca___

- First release of new tool "noncompartmental analysis"


   ___sir___

- First release of new tool "sampling importance resampling


   ___rawresults___

- First release of new tool "rawresults" that will create a raw results file from .mod and .lst files in a directory


   ___update_inits___

- update_inits now has a userguide

- can handle any file extension of the modelfile, not only .mod

- can auto-renumber when file name is something like run123<some letters>.mod

- can now handle new NONMEM records (e.g. $THETAPD)
