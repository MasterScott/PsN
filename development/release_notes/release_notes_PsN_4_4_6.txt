************************
Installation
************************

Follow the installation instructions on
http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

************************
Documentation
************************
All documentation is found in the doc subdirectory of the PsN 
installation directory. During installation it is also possible 
to have all documentation copied to a user-specified directory.

All documentation can also be downloaded from
the PsN website http://psn.sourceforge.net/

************************
Dependencies 
************************

- It is recommended to use Xpose version 4.5.3 for the -cwres functionality 
  and the default execute, vpc and bootstrap R plots.

************************
Known issues 
************************

- Windows users need to be careful to choose 
  a Perl version where the extra modules needed for PsN are available. See the 
  instructions on http://psn.sourceforge.net/install.php

- Installation problem on some Windows systems where 
  perl 'system' command does not work. Make sure perl module File::Copy::Recursive
  is installed *before* (re)running the installation script setup.pl

*********************************************
Changes and bug fixes from PsN 4.4.0 to 4.4.6
*********************************************

   ___General___

- Bug fix: reading of $DATA when IGNORE=(list) has a list that is split over two or 
  more lines

- Bug fix: added file extensions .cpu, .agh and .shm to output files handled for NM7

- Bug fix: Correct search for nmfe script when major version is 6 and subversion is 
  defined in psn.conf.

- Bug fix: Relax checking of -nmfe_options so that -maxlim=(1,2) does not trigger warning.

- Bug fix: Reading of elapsed estimation time for SAEM.

- Bug fix: Reading of total run time when run time is 0 seconds.

- Bug fix: Parsing of $SIGMA/$OMEGA when comma is used instead of space as in $SIGMA 1,FIX

- Bug fix: Do not require that psn.conf exists during installation

- Bug fix: When reading matrices from lst-file, handle also NONMEM's sparse matrix format

- Bug fix: Reading of matrices from lst-files when .cov, .coi, .cor not available and 
  	  	   $OMEGA and/or $SIGMA has either at least one block of at least size 3, 
		   or two or more blocks of at least size 2.

- Bug fix: Parsing of ext-file from NM7.1.2 when there are multiple $PROB with one 
  	  	   $EST MAXEVAL=0 each, as in for example sir program when option 
		   -problems_per_file is > 1, and -dofv functionality of bootstrap. 

- Bug fix: Parsing of ext-file from NM7.2.0 and NM7.3.0 for $PROBLEMs where a $SIM 
  	  	   is followed by at least two $EST where the last $EST has MAXEVAL=0 and 
		   at least one previous in the same $PROBLEM does not have MAXEVAL=0.

   ___mcmp___

- Bug fix: allow option -significance_level=0.1 which did not work

- Add new significance levels 20, 15 and 10% to existing set of 5,1 and 0.1%. Updated 
  rplots template to include the new significance levels.

- Updated documentation.


   ___sumo___

- Bug fix: Check for high correlations. In older versions high correlations would not 
  be reported. 

- Bug fix: Check for large relative standard errors. In older versions many large 
  SEs were missed.

- Bug fix: Make sure omega/sigma correlations are computed also when variances are small. 


   ___vpc/npc___

- Bug fix: Correction in confidence intervals for median of percent censored observations 
  when using option -censor.

- Bug fix: Do not warn that $INPUT uses synonym for DV when -dv is set on command-line.

- Bug fix: Handle option combination -bin_by_count=1 -bin_array=<> 

- Bug fix: Handle option -flip_comments in combination with $DATA that has file name 
  enclosed by quotes.


   ___scm___

- Bug fix: Use -threads set on command-line also in first iteration.

- Bug fix: In cases when data filtration step is run, handle $INPUT with items of the 
  form NAME=DROP or NAME=SKIP, in addition to just DROP or SKIP without NAME.

- Some clarifications in the documentation regarding -time_varying.

   ___sse___

- New option -append_columns=col1,col2,... A comma-separated list of parameters to append 
  to the simulated data sets, if desired.

   ___update_inits___
	 
- Bug fix: Rounding of negative values and values with absolute value >= 10

- New option -flip_comments

- New option -nm_version, so that rounding of initial estimates is done based on major 
  NM-version (7 or less than 7)

   ___execute___
	 
- Bug fix: minor fix -rplots when detecting xpose run number from table file names: 
  do not include 'sim' in the run number, i.e. for sdtab65sim the run number is just 65

- Documentation that parentheses in -nmfe_options must be escaped on Unix/Linux.

   ___sir___
	 
- Major redesign of algorithm: run multiple iterations where resampled parameters 
  from one iteration is used to generate proposal density for the next. 
  The resampled parameters will be Box-Cox transformed to normality so that a 
  built-in Perl function for sampling from a multivariate normal can be used in the next 
  iteration.

- Bug fix: Detection of NaN that string evaluate to 0 (on Windows).

   ___precond___
	 
- Some clarifications in the documentation.

   ___runrecord___

- Bug fix: Correction in documentation so that tags for interindividual and interoccasion 
  variability in documentation match what is expected in the code

   ___nmoutput2so___

- Add DVID to Preditions and Residuals if present in sdtab

- Add support for multiple DVs in simulations

- Add CWRES if present in sdtab

- Residuals renamed from Residual
  
- Add bootstrap results file to RawResults
