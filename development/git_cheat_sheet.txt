Remote branches for private backup purposes,
i.e. single person working on branch:

git branch <branch>				#create branch locally
git push origin <branch>  	  	#push empty branch to origin
git checkout <branch>   	  	#switch to branch locally

{ #iterate until done with branch
 #work on branch, commit, work, commit
 git push origin <branch>  		#push work to origin branch
}

git checkout master				#switch to master locally
git merge <branch>  			#merge local branch to local master
git push    					# push master, with merged branch, to origin
git push origin --delete <branch>   #remove branch from origin
git branch -d <branch> 	 			#remove branch locally


#check with gitk!
