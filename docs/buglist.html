<h2 class="heading1">Bugs</h2>
<p>The most common source of errors are problems with psn.conf. Instructions about how to make correct settings can be found in <a href='https://github.com/UUPharmacometrics/PsN/releases/download/v4.6.0/psn_configuration.pdf'>psn_configuration.pdf</a>.</p>
<p> Like all software, PsN has bugs. Some unfixed bugs and known workarounds can be found in the document <a href='https://github.com/UUPharmacometrics/PsN/releases/download/v4.6.0/known_bugs_and_workarounds.pdf'>known_bugs_and_workarounds.pdf</a>. 
Please help us to get better by letting us know about undocumented errors or problems.</p>
<p>
The best way to submit a bug is to <a
 href="mailto:psn-general@lists.sourceforge.net">send a message</a> to
the PsN-general mailing list. Before you send your mail please check the <a
target="_blank"
 href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=101419">mailing
list archives</a> to see if the bug has not
been submitted already. In your mail try to
describe, in reasonable detail, what the bug is and what you did when
it appeared. Always include the call you used to start PsN and all messages that PsN gave up until the crash. Also, add your PsN version, the name of your operating system (e.g. Windows XP, Mac OS X, Red Hat linux, etc.) and
anything else that might be helpful. From there we will try to help you
out. Maybe you will also get help from other users on the mailing
list. Do not send model files and data files unless we ask you to.</p>
