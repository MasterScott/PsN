<h2 class="heading1">Bugs</h2>
<p>The most common source of errors are problems with psn.conf. Instructions about how to make correct settings can be found in <a href='https://github.com/UUPharmacometrics/PsN/releases/download/v4.6.0/psn_configuration.pdf'>psn_configuration.pdf</a>.</p>
<p> Like all software, PsN has bugs. Some unfixed bugs and known workarounds can be found in the document <a href='https://github.com/UUPharmacometrics/PsN/releases/download/v4.6.0/known_bugs_and_workarounds.pdf'>known_bugs_and_workarounds.pdf</a>. 
Please help us to get better by letting us know about undocumented errors or problems.</p>
<p>
The best way to submit a bug is to <a
 href="mailto:psn-general@lists.sourceforge.net">send a message</a> to
the PsN-general mailing list. Before you send your mail please check the <a
target="_blank"
 href="http://sourceforge.net/mail/?group_id=101419">mailing
list archives</a> to see if the bug has not
been submitted already. In your mail try to
describe, in reasonable detail, what the bug is and what you did when
it appeared. Always include the call you used to start PsN and all messages that PsN gave up until the crash. Also, add your PsN version, the name of your operating system (e.g. Windows XP, Mac OS X, Red Hat linux, etc.) and
anything else that might be helpful. From there we will try to help you
out. Maybe you will also get help from other users on the mailing
list. Do not send model files and data files unless we ask you to.</p>

<h3>Known bugs in current release </h3>

This list holds information about bugs found in PsN-4.6.0

<ul>
	<li>bias and relative bias in cdd_results.csv are incorrect when option -bins is not set. To get the correct bias value, the displayed values should be multiplied with (1- 'default number of bins') where the default number of bins is the number of individuals (or cases).</li>

	<li>sse will use the wrong simulated data for reestimation if the simulation model file has more than one $INPUT statement. The table file with simulated data used for reestimation will only include the items from the last $INPUT. Note: It works fine to split $INPUT over several lines, as long as the text $INPUT only appears once.</li>

	<li>Data values with more than five significant digits in sse
    The simulated datasets used in sse are \$TABLE output from NONMEM, and NONMEM rounds off values when printing tables. In NONMEM 6 1013201 is rounded to 1013200 (five significant digits), and if this makes a significant change to the model estimation, for example if the value is a covariate, then the sse results will be wrong. In NONMEM7 it is possible to set the FORMAT option in $TABLE to make sure no important information is lost. With NONMEM 6 the user must make sure the rounding to five significant digits does not harm the results.</li>

	<li>Lower case user defined and reserved words
    Starting with NONMEM 7.2 lower case user defined and reserved words are supported. This is not supported
    by PsN. For example in $INPUT all reserved words have to be upper case.</li>

	<li>
A bug with potentially serious consequences has been discovered in the scm program in PsN release versions 4.4.8 and 4.6.0. The bug is triggered when there is a dropped covariate (i.e. in $INPUT the user has set DROP/SKIP on a covariate which is listed in continuous_covariates or categorical_covariates in the scm config file) *in combination with* the data filtering step (i.e. when $DATA has an IGNORE statement which is more complex than IGNORE=&lt;single character&gt;). 

When *both* these conditions are met, scm-4.6.0 and scm-4.4.8 will during the filtering step replace the DROP-ped covariate with a placeholder column (the first undropped column, which usually is the ID-column), but then later un-DROP the corresponding item in $INPUT when it is found that the item is listed as a covariate in the scm config file. This results in the placeholder column being tested as a covariate in the scm run instead of the correct data column. The file covariate_statistics.txt shows what values where actually used for the covariate in the scm run, so check this file to see if an old scm run has been affected by the bug.

PsN release 4.4.0 is not affected by this bug (the run will crash if a covariate is dropped in $INPUT and the filtering step is triggered). In PsN versions >= 4.6.6 and all later versions there is an input check that no covariates are DROPped or SKIPped in $INPUT, preventing the above error.
