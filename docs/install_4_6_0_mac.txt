Mac users with the latest version(s) of Mac Os cannot accept the default installation
folder for PsN utilities, even when installing as root. Do the following:

Run setup.pl as root. When setup.pl prompts for Utilities directory like this:

PsN Utilities installation directory [/usr/bin]:

then enter /usr/local/bin and hit Enter:

PsN Utilities installation directory [/usr/bin]: /usr/local/bin

The other defaults can be accepted. 

If there is a message about PsN already being installed this message is misleading,
what it should say is that PsN is already *partially* installed. This is not an error,
just say yes to continuing.

---------------

Alternatively, the modified installation script setup4_6_0.pl can be used,
http://sourceforge.net/projects/psn/files/setup4_6_0.pl/download
where the default has been changed to /usr/local/bin

Why the default cannot be used:

Not even root has write permissions in /usr/bin in the latest version(s) of Mac OS
and therefore setup.pl cannot install anything there. What we want to do is use
another directory which is already in $PATH *and* where root has write permission.

Experienced users may choose an entirely different installation directory, and
then add it to $PATH.
In Uppsala we use /opt/PsN/bin for utilities and /opt/PsN for Core and Toolkit,
and have /opt/PsN/bin in $PATH.
