\section{Introduction}
The parallel\_retries script is a PsN tool that allows you to run 
multiple copies of
a single model with tweaked initial estimates in parallel.
In PsN terminology it is called a retry to (re)run a model with tweaked 
initial estimates.

The retries, see details below, 
are always done serially in execute and other PsN programs. 
The parallel\_retries script is a help script that takes a single model 
as input, creates 'min\_retries' extra copies of this model 
with tweaked initial estimates, and then runs the original plus 
the extra models in parallel in separate NM\_run subdirectories. 
Results are summarized in raw\_results.csv and parallel\_retries\_results.csv
in the run directory. 
The script will select the best retry using the same criteria as execute,
and copy back output files (NONMEM files, table files) from the selected retry to the
input model's directory.

The script parallel\_retries accept all
options in common\_options.pdf. 

Example
\begin{verbatim}
parallel_retries run33.mod -min_retries=4 -threads=5 -seed=12345
\end{verbatim}

\section{Input and options}
\subsection{Required input}
A model file is required on the command-line. 
In addition, either -min\_retries or -rawres\_input is required, see below.

\subsection{Optional input}
\begin{optionlist}
\optdefault{min\_retries}{integer}
The number of model copies with tweaked initial estimates to run. 
If this option is not used then -rawres\_input must be set.
\nextopt
\optdefault{rawres\_input}{filename}
Default not used. If this option is not used then -min\_retries must be used.
An alternative way to estimate with different initial estimates. 
Instead of using initial estimates from a random perturbation, take parameter initial values from a raw\_results-like file.
The raw results file must contain at least as many samples as the input -samples to parallel\_retries, the labels for  THETA/OMEGA/SIGMA 
in the file must match the labels in the simulation model given as input to parallel\_retries, 
the theta columns must be directly followed by the omega columns which must be directly followed by the sigma columns, and the first column 
must have header model just as a bootstrap raw\_results file. Note that is is possible to generate a file with initial parameter estimates outside of PsN, 
as long as the file follows the format rules.
\nextopt
\optdefault{samples}{N}
Only valid in combination with -rawres\_input, see above. The number of
parameter sets to use from the rawres\_input file. 
Default is to use all sets after skipping the first 'offset\_rawres' sets.
\nextopt
\optdefault{offset\_rawres}{N}
Only valid in combination with -rawres\_input, see above. Default 1.
The number of result lines to skip in the input raw results file before starting to read final parameter estimates. In a regular
bootstrap raw\_results file the first line of estimates refers to the input model with the full dataset, so therefore the default offset is 1.
\nextopt
\optname{keep\_table\_files}
Default not set. If set then do not clean table files for the not-chosen
retry models from the main run directory.
\nextopt
\optname{keep\_nm\_output}
Default not set. If set then do not clean nm\_output files for the not-chosen
retry models from the main run directory.
\optname{model\_dir\_name}
Default not used. This option changes the basename of the run directory from 
parallel\_retries\_dir to $\langle$modelfile$\rangle$.dir. where $\langle$modelfile$\rangle$ 
is the name of the (first) input model file, without the extension. 
The directories will be numbered starting from 1, increasing the number each time parallel\_retries 
is run with a model file with the 
same name. If the option directory is used it will override -model\_dir\_name.
\nextopt
\optname{timestamp}
Default not used. This option changes the name of the run directory to $\langle$modelfile$\rangle$-PsN-$\langle$date$\rangle$
where $\langle$modelfile$\rangle$ is the name of the first model file in the list given as arguments, without the extension,
and $\langle$date$\rangle$ is the time and date the run was started. 
Example: directory name run1-PsN-2014-06-12-152502 for a run that was started at 15:25:02 June 12th in year 2014.
If the option directory is used it will override -timestamp.
\nextopt
\optname{prepend\_options\_to\_lst}
Default not used. This option makes PsN prepend the final lst-file (which is copied back to the directory from which parallel\_retries was called) with the file version\_and\_option\_info.txt which contains run information, including     all actual values of optional PsN options. PsN can still parse the lst-file with the options prepended, so the file can still be used it as input to e.g. sumo, vpc or update\_inits. Disabled with -no-prepend\_options\_to\_lst if set in psn.conf.
\nextopt
\end{optionlist}

\subsection{Some important common PsN options}
All options listed in document common\_options.pdf apply to parallel\_retries. 
Below is a set of basic options. For a complete list see common\_options.pdf, 
or psn\_options -h on the commandline.
\input{inputs/basic_options.tex}

\section{Output}
When the NONMEM runs are finished, the raw\_results file 
and parallel\_retries\_results.csv
in the
main run directory will contain a summary of the results of the 
retries.
