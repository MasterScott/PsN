\section{Introduction}
The nmoutput2so script creates and populates a DDMoRe Standardized Output 
\cite{Terranova}
xml file given the output from one or more NONMEM runs. 
It is necessary that the format of the model file and other files follow a set of requirements (see below) for this to work. The Perl module XML::LibXML is required by nmoutput2so, but not PsN in general. Make sure that it is installed before using nmoutput2so. See the PsN installation guide for intructions.


Examples
\begin{verbatim}
nmoutput2so model.lst
\end{verbatim}

\section{Input and options}

\subsection{Required input}
Required argument is a list of nonmem results files (.lst). Wildcards will work (i.e. *.lst)


\subsection{Optional input}

\begin{optionlist}
\optname{bootstrap\_results}
A PsN bootstrap\_results.csv file to use for filling the Bootstrap elements.
\nextopt
\optname{use\_tables}
Default set. Will use table files (sdtab, patab and cotab) to populate the elements of the SO that needs these. Use -no-use\_tables to not use any table files.
\nextopt
\optname{exclude\_elements}
Set a comma separated list of simple XPaths relative the SOBlock to exclude from the SO.
For example:
\begin{verbatim}
-exclude_elements=Estimation/PopulationEstimates
\end{verbatim}
\nextopt
\optname{only\_include\_elements}
Set a comma separated list of simple XPaths relative the SOBlock. These elements will be the only ones used.
For example: 
\begin{verbatim}
-only_include_elements=Estimation/Likelihood
\end{verbatim}

\section{Requirements on the model file and other files}

\subsection{Requirements on the model file}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All NONMEM parameters (THETAs, OMEGAs and SIGMAs) must have labels. A label is a one word (and only one word) comment on the same line as the definition of the initial estimate of the parameter. This means that all block definitions must be written on different rows. Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
$OMEGA BLOCK(2)
 1.2     ; PPV_CL
 0.01    ; CORR_CL_V
 0.1     ; PPV_V
        \end{verbatim}
    \item To be able to populate the Residuals and the Predictions entries (or SimulatedProfiles for simulations) an sdtab table must be specified. The names but not the order of the columns is important. ID and TIME must be in the table. Other columns are optional. The example below shows an sdtab with all columns. The name of the file must start with "sdtab" Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
$TABLE ID TIME MDV DV PRED IPRED RES IRES WRES IWRES CWRES NOAPPEND FILE=sdtab2
        \end{verbatim}
    \item To be able to populate the IndividualEstimates (or the IndivParameters for simulations) entry a patab table must be specified. NOAPPEND must be used and the order of the columns is important. The first column must be ID, then comes all individual parameters followed by the ETAs (see below). Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
$TABLE ID CL V ETA_CL ETA_V NOAPPEND FILE=patab
        \end{verbatim}
    \item To be able to populate the Covariates entry in Simulation a cotab table must be specified. The names but not the order of the columns are important. ID and TIME must be in the table. Other columns are covariates. The name of the file must start with "cotab". Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
$TABLE ID TIME WGT NOPRINT NOAPPEND FILE=cotab
        \end{verbatim}
    \item To be able to populate the RandomEffects entry all ETAs must be defined in the main code block (\$PK or \$PRED). One ETA should be defined per row with nothing more on the row (except for spaces) than one assignment. Example:
        \begin{verbatim}
 ETA_CL = ETA(1)
 ETA_V = ETA(2)
        \end{verbatim}
    \item If multiple DVs are to be used a DVID column must be set in the sdtab.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Requirements on other files}
\begin{itemize}
    \item All nonmem result files must have the same filename (excluding extension) as the .lst file. If not it is impossible to pick up the results from the .ext, .cov, .cor files etc.
\end{itemize}

\section{Known limitations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The full xml file is stored in memory at once. This means that big results, for example big simulations, can potentially use a lot or all of the available memory.
    \item To be able to filter out dose rows for SimulatedProfiles and Residuals and MDV column must be included in the sdtab otherwise all rows will be added.
    \item PopulationParameters for simulations are assumed to be fixed for all individuals and occations thus not supporting \$PRIOR
    \item All parameters in a bootstrap will be on the var/cov scale regardless of the scale used in the model.
    \item Parameters with no labels will not generate any warnings for bootstrap when given on the sd/corr scale.
\end{itemize}

\section{Output}

The resulting standardized output object xml will be written to the file called <name of .lst file>.so\_xml.

The following entries will be populated:

\begin{itemize}
    \item RawResults - All used files and some selected not used files will be added. See the section on raw results for more info
    \item TaskInformation 
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Message - Errors, warnings etc will be put here. See section "information messages"
            \item RunTime - From the .lst file. Remember that RunTime only reflects the run time reported by NONMEM in the .lst file. No PsN runtime will be reported.
        \end{itemize}
    \item Estimation
        \begin{itemize}
            \item PopulationEstimates
            \begin{itemize}

                \end{itemize}
                \item MLE - Results will be taken from the .ext file if present otherwise the .lst file. Parameters that are fixed and does not have a label will not be included. The estimated value
                    will be on the standard deviation/correlation scale or variance/covariance scale depending on which scale the initial estimate was on. 
            \end{itemize}
            \item PrecisionPopulationEstimates
            \begin{itemize}

                    \item EffectMean - Calculated from the patab if ETAs are named correctly
                \end{itemize}
            \end{itemize}

            \end{itemize}
        \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Raw results}
Some special raw results files in the RawResults section of the SO will have a specific oid set. This makes it easier to programatically find the files. Here follows a list of these files and oids:

\begin{tabular}{ l l}
      oid & file \\
    \hline
      PsN\_bootstrap\_results & bootstrap\_results.csv \\
      PsN\_bootstrap\_included\_individuals & included\_individuals1.csv \\
      PsN\_bootstrap\_raw\_results & raw\_results\_<model>.csv \\
      PsN\_SSE\_results & sse\_results.csv \\
      PsN\_SSE\_raw\_results & raw\_results\_<model>.csv \\
      PsN\_VPC\_results & vpc\_results.csv \\
      PsN\_VPC\_vpctab & vpctab<num> \\
\end{tabular}



\subsection{Information messages}
A set of tool specific information messages are added in TaskInformation. They are listed table below:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{minimization\_successful} \\ Set to 1 if the minimization was successful otherwise set to 0.
    \item \textbf{covariance\_step\_run} \\ Set to 1 if the covariance step was run otherwise set to 0. The information is taken from the .lst file
    \item \textbf{covariance\_step\_successful} \\ Set to 1 if the covariance step was successful
    \item \textbf{covariance\_step\_warnings} \\ Set to 1 if any of "R MATRIX ALGORITHMICALLY SINGULAR" or "S MATRIX ALGORITHMICALLY SINGULAR" is present in the .lst file. Set to 0 otherwise.
    \item \textbf{rounding\_errors} \\ Set to 1 if "ROUNDING ERRORS" is present in the .lst file.  Set to 0 otherwise.
    \item \textbf{hessian\_reset} \\ Set to the number of appearances of "RESET HESSIAN" in the .lst file
    \item \textbf{zero\_gradients} \\ Set to the number of zero gradients in the "GRADIENT" lists of the .lst file
    \item \textbf{final\_zero\_gradients} \\ Number of zero gradients in the final iteration in the .lst file.
    \item \textbf{estimate\_near\_boundary} \\ Set to 1 if any of "ESTIMATE OF THETA IS NEAR THE BOUNDARY" or "PARAMETER ESTIMATE IS NEAR ITS BOUNDARY" is present in the .lst file. Set to 0 otherwise.
    \item \textbf{significant\_digits} \\ NO. OF SIG. DIGITS IN FINAL EST. from .lst file
    \item \textbf{s\_matrix\_singular} \\ Set to 1 if "S MATRIX ALGORITHMICALLY SINGULAR" present in .lst file. Set to 0 otherwise.
    \item \textbf{condition\_number} \\ If the eigenvalues of the correlation matrix was printed to the .lst file (i.e. option PRINT=E was given to \$COV) nnmoutput2so calculates the condition number. 
\end{itemize}
