\section{Introduction}
The sir program calculates uncertainty
on model parameters for the input model using the Sampling Importance Resampling (SIR) procedure.
The SIR procedure is described in
\emph{Application of Sampling Importance Resampling to estimate parameter uncertainty distributions}, 
PAGE 22 (2013) Abstr 2907, Dosne AG, Bergstrand M, Karlsson MO. 

First, parameter vectors will be simulated from the truncated multivariate normal distribution 
given by the covariance matrix output from NONMEM's covariance step
(or, if NONMEM's covariance step was not successful, a faked NONMEM covariance matrix).
%(alternatively, a file with simulated parameter vectors can be given directly as input and this simulation is skipped)
Second, each of the simulated parameter vectors will be evaluated on the original data (MAXEVAL=0).
Third, based on these evaluations, weights will be calculated for each of the parameter vectors and the vectors 
will be resampled according to these weights. Finally, the uncertainty covariance matrix of the parameters 
will be computed from the resampled parameter vectors.

Example
\begin{verbatim}
sir -samples=5000 -resamples=1000 run0.mod
\end{verbatim}

\section{Input and options}
A model file is required on the command-line. Also, the .lst/.cov/.coi-files of the model file must contain results from a successful covariance step \emph{or} 
the \$COV step in the model file must be possible to run successfully. Note that it is possible to fake a successful covariance step, see section 
Procedure in case of a failed \$COV step below.
\begin{optionlist}
\optdefault{samples}{N}
Required. The number of parameter vectors to generate. Needs to be greater than the number of resamples. A good starting point may be 5 times the number of resamples.
\nextopt
\optdefault{resamples}{N}
Required. The number of parameter vectors to resample based on the weights
computed from delta ofv and the pdf. Only these will be used to compute the uncertainty (confidence intervals) around the model parameters. A good strating point may be 1000 resamples.
\nextopt
\optdefault{mceta}{N}
Optional. Sets option MCETA=N in \$ESTIMATION. Only allowed with NM7.3 and classical estimation methods.
\nextopt
%\optdefault{rawres\_input}{filename}
%If rawres\_input is given, sir will take samples sets of parameter
%vectors from this file, starting on line offset\_rawres+1, instead of
%drawing samples from a truncated multivariate normal distribution 
%based on the input model parameter estimates and 
%covariance matrix.
%The raw results file must contain at least as many 
%samples as the input -samples to sir, the labels for  THETA/OMEGA/SIGMA 
%in the file must match the labels in the model given as input 
%to sir, the theta columns must be directly followed by the omega columns 
%which must be directly followed by the sigma columns, and the first or
%second column must have header model. Note that is is 
%possible to generate a file with initial parameter estimates outside 
%of PsN, as long as the file follows the format rules.
%\nextopt
%\optdefault{offset\_rawres}{N}
%Default 1. The number of parameter sets to skip in rawres file. Only allowed in combination with rawres\_input.
%\nextopt
%\optdefault{in\_filter}{condition on numerical col}
%Default not used. Only allowed in combination with rawres\_input.
%\nextopt
%\optdefault{out\_filter}{condition on numerical col}
%Default not used. .
%\nextopt
\optname{with\_replacement}
Default not set. By default, resampling is performed without replacement, but setting this option gives resampling with replacement.
\nextopt
\optname{copy\_data}
Default not set. If option is not set, the data file will not be copied from the m1 directory to the NM\_run directories for NONMEM execution, which saves disk space. If -copy\_data is set, the data file will be copied to each NM\_run directory.
\nextopt
%\optdefault{covmat\_input}{filename}
%Only allowed together with rawres\_input. If given, this matrix is
%used for computing the weights. If rawres\_input is given without covmat\_input, all vectors will be assigned the same PDF, meaning that only delta-ofv will influence the resampling.
%\nextopt
\optdefault{inflation}{X}
Default is 1, which is the same as no inflation. If given, the covariance
matrix will be multiplied with this number before the parameter vectors
are sampled from the truncated multivariate normal distribution.
The weights will however still be computed based the non-inflated covariance matrix. 
\nextopt
\end{optionlist}


\section{sir program workflow}
\begin{itemize}
\item[\underline{Setup}] The sir program will run the input model unless the lst-file with results is already present.
\item[\underline{Step 1}] Simulate 'samples' parameter vectors from the covariance matrix ( the .cov-file) given by NONMEM (or the fake covariance matrix). 
Calculate each vector’s probability given the covariance matrix based on the formula for the probability 
density function (PDF) of a multivariate normal distribution. Store parameter values and probabilities in raw\_results.csv.
%NB: NOT performed if –rawres\_input is specified.
\item[\underline{Step 2}] evaluate the parameter vectors on the original data.
Create model files with up to 250 \$PROBLEM based on the original model file but setting MAXEVAL=0
and replacing inits of nth \$PROBLEM with nth parameter vector, and also set MCETA if option -mceta was used. Compute dOFV 
(delta-OFV, reference is input model ofv) and store in raw\_results.csv.
\item[\underline{Step 3}] calculate the weights as the ratio $\frac{e^{-0.5\cdot dOFV}}{PDF}$ and store in raw\_results.csv. 
Resample 'resamples' parameter vectors based on these weights, with or without replacement depending on option -with\_replacement. 
Store the number of times each vector was resampled in raw\_results.csv.
Compute the covariance matrix for the resampled parameters (variances and covariances), 
store in sir\_results.csv. 
Compute univariate confidence intervals and store in sir\_results.csv.
\end{itemize}

\section{Procedure in case of a failed \$COV step}
The sir program currently requires the output from a successful NONMEM \$COV-step to be available. If the \$COV-step failed it is possible, although a little awkward, to trick sir to use fake covariance step output instead.
\begin{enumerate}
\item Copy the .mod, .lst and .ext files from a run with successful estimation but failed covariance step. In the following it is assumed that the copies are called run1.mod, run1.lst and run1.ext.
\item Make sure run1.lst will indicate to sir that the \$COV step was run. At the top of run1.lst there is a copy of the control stream (run1.mod). Make sure that the control stream includes \$COV. Save and close run1.lst.
\item Edit run1.ext to trick sir that the covariance step was successful. 
\begin{enumerate}
\item In the last table of the file, remove the line starting with -1000000001 if it exists. 
\item Copy the line starting with -1000000000 and insert the copy directly underneath the original line. 
\item Change the leading -1000000000 of the copy to -1000000001. 
\item For each THETA/SIGMA/OMEGA that was \emph{not} estimated (because it was zero or FIXED in the control stream) set the value in the copied line to 1.00000E+10 (the NONMEM output value signalling that this value was not estimated).
\item Save and close run1.ext.
\end{enumerate}
\item Create a header to be used in fake run1.cov, run1.coi and run1.cor. Copy the the header (both the TABLE and the ITERATION line) from the last table of run1.ext. Change ITERATION to NAME and remove the column header OBJ from the second line.
\item Create a fake run1.cov that looks like a true NONMEM cov-file. Use the fake header from the previous step, and row labels copied from the NAME line of the header. For each THETA/SIGMA/OMEGA that was \emph{not} estimated (because it was zero or FIXED in the control stream) set the value in the matrix to 0.00000E+00 (zero). Make sure the matrix is symmetric and invertable. Save and close run1.cov.
\item Create a fake run1.coi with the true inverse of the matrix in run1.cov. The headers and row labels should be the same as in run1.cov. For each THETA/SIGMA/OMEGA that was not estimated set the value in the matrix to 0.00000E+00. 
\item Copy run1.coi to run1.cor. The file run1.cor will not be used by sir, but it needs to be present in the same folder as run1.coi when faking a successful covariance step.
\item Make sure the files run1.mod, run1.lst, run1.cov, run1.coi and run1.cor are all in the same folder. Run the sir program with run1.mod as the input model. 
\end{enumerate}
