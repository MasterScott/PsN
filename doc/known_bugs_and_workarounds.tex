\section{Introduction}
Work to fix bugs in PsN is ongoing, but often feature addition is prioritized over bug fixing, especially if there is a known workaround for the bug. This document list the most important known bugs, including workarounds when possible.   

\section{Bugs}

\subsection{Sensitive format for raw results input file in sse, vpc, npc}
Any column header that contains a comma, e.g. OMEGA(2,1), must be enclosed in double quotes. This is done automatically when PsN creates a raw results file but may be changed if the file is saved in e.g. Excel.

\subsection{Use prior-specific records for \$PRIOR NWPRI}
When a control stream has multiple \$PROBLEM \emph{and} the first \$PROBLEM has \$PRIOR NWPRI
\emph{and} the prior parameters are encoded with \$THETA/\$OMEGA/\$SIGMA instead of the
prior-specific records \$THETAP, \$THETAPV, \$OMEGAP etc, then PsN will not be able to handle the parameter column
headers correctly in the raw\_results file. The workaround is to always use the prior-specific records 
(\$THETAP etc) for encoding the prior information.

It especially important to use the prior-specific records when running sir,  
or bootstrap with option -dofv,
with a model that has \$PRIOR NWPRI. In
those two cases PsN will itself create a control stream with multiple \$PROBLEM.

\subsection{Missing estimates in raw\_results.csv when first \$PROBLEM uses \$MSFI}
When the first \$PROBLEM in the modelfile uses \$MSFI, and \$THETA, \$OMEGA and \$SIGMA are all missing in that \$PROBLEM, then there will be no theta/omega/sigma headers in raw\_results.csv and the parameter estimates will not be printed to the file.

\subsection{Data values with more than five significant digits in sse}
The simulated datasets used in sse are \$TABLE output from NONMEM, and NONMEM rounds off values when printing tables. In NONMEM 6 1013201 is rounded to 1013200 (five significant digits), and if this makes a significant change to the model estimation, for example if the value is a covariate, then the sse results will be wrong. In NONMEM7 it is possible to set the FORMAT option in \$TABLE to make sure no important information is lost. With NONMEM 6 the user must make sure the rounding to five significant digits does not harm the results.

\subsection{Lower case user defined and reserved words}
Starting with NONMEM 7.2 lower case user defined and reserved words are supported. This is not supported
by PsN. For example in \$INPUT all reserved words have to be upper case.
