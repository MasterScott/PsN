\begin{optionlist}
\optname{omega\_before\_pk}
Default not set. In PsN version 3.4.4 and earlier, \$OMEGA was always printed before \$PK. The new default is to keep the record order of the input model file. To use the old print order, set option -omega\_before\_pk
\nextopt
\optname{psn\_record\_order}
Default not set. In PsN 4.3.3 and earlier, PsN used an internal record order. The new default is to keep the record order of the input model file. Set this option to use the old order.
\nextopt
\optname{sde}
Default not set. In PsN version 3.4.4 and earlier, this option made PsN print the records
in a particular order suitable for SDE models.
The new default is to keep the record order of the input model file. To use the old SDE print order, 
set option -sde.
\nextopt
\optname{last\_est\_complete}
Default not set. Only applies for models with multiple \$ESTIMATION (NONMEM7 only). 
Only affects vpc,  cdd if option -xv is set, and execute if option -mirror\_plots,
-predict\_model or -nonparametric\_etas is set. Indicates that no options needed for the last \$EST 
are carried over from previous \$EST, all options are set explicitly in that record. See PsN\_and\_NONMEM7.pdf 
for details. 
\nextopt
\optdefault{niter\_eonly}{'integer'}
Default undefined. Only applies for NONMEM7 and if last \$EST is IMP or IMPMAP. 
Only affects vpc,  cdd if option -xv is set, and execute if option -mirror\_plots, -predict\_model
 or -nonparametric\_etas is set. 
User-chosen value of NITER when estimation is turned off by setting EONLY=1. See PsN\_and\_NONMEM7.pdf for details. 
\nextopt
