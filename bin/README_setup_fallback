Please do the following:

1) Make sure you have a working internet connection. Then open a (DOS)
command window and run the command (all spaces and dashes are important)

ppm install file-copy-recursive

This installs a perl module needed for the alternative installation
script. If there are error messages about this perl module installation
you need to handle them before you can proceed to install PsN.

2) Place the script setup_fallback.pl in the same folder as where you have the file
setup.pl, i.e. in the PsN-Source folder. Then follow the same installation
instructions as before, but wherever the instructions say 'setup.pl' use
'setup_fallback.pl' instead.
